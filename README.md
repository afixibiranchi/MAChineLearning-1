# MAChineLearning

Machine Learning for the Mac


## Intro

This framework provides a quick and easy way to experiment with machine learning with native code on the Mac. It is written in Objective-C and it is usable by Swift.

Currenlty the framework supports:

- [Neural Networks](NeuralNets.md)
- [Bag of Words](BagOfWords.md)


### Use on iOS

The library should work well on iOS too. Ideally, one could write a program on the Mac to train the network, save its status and then load it on an iPhone or iPad and use it pre-trained. Haven't tested this scenario, but I see no reason it should not work.


## About

I am a professional developer but not a data scientist. I wrote this library because, you know, they say you haven't really understood something until you can code it. So, here it is. Use it to experiment and have fun, and if you find it useful I will be happy to hear it at [@self_vs_this](http://www.twitter.com/self_vs_this).

Every effort has been taken to guarantee the library is error-free, including a side-by-side weights/results comparision with other open source libraries. If you find bugs or conceptual mistakes please report them. So I can fix them and, most importantly, learn something new.

Enjoy.
